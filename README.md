This is where I play with the Python Language.  
I do not consider myself a full-fledged python person yet.  
I am just learning by having fun.  I am hoping that this
will make me a better programmer.

You will also notice that I comment everything I need to;
Some may think that this is too much but when I started
learning to code I was taught that commenting makes life
easier for those who follow.
